# Short Written Reflection (4–6 sentences total)

 The approach to data storytelling effectively uses "context before details" by establishing the demographic "who" before revealing the "what" (outcomes), a strategy essential for engaging clinical audiences. Regarding the data model, recognizing that complex healthcare data necessitates relationships over standard joins is key; relationships prevent data duplication and inflation of row counts, maintaining data integrity and query efficiency across linked tables like patient encounters, diagnoses, and billing. This understanding directly supports the healthcare scenario where Tableau can be leveraged to accurately calculate and visualize critical metrics like 30-day readmission rates, making it easy for clinicians and administrators to quickly identify high-risk diagnoses or discharge patterns. This rapid, accessible insight is crucial for driving targeted quality improvements and reducing costly readmissions.
